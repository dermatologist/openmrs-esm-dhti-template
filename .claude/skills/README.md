# Agent Skills

This directory contains agent skills for AI-powered coding assistants like GitHub Copilot, Claude, and other AI development tools.

## What are Agent Skills?

Agent skills are specialized instructions that help AI coding assistants understand how to work with this repository. They provide context, workflows, and best practices specific to this project.

## Available Skills

### OpenMRS Conch Agent Skill (`SKILL.md`)

This skill helps AI assistants generate new OpenMRS ESM microfrontends (conch) from this template. It provides comprehensive guidance on:

- Setting up a development environment
- Scaffolding new microfrontend projects
- Implementing GenAI-powered features
- Integrating with the OpenMRS 3.x ecosystem
- Working with DHTI (Digital Health Technology & Innovation) services

**Use this skill when:** You need to create a new DHTI-enabled healthcare application or OpenMRS microfrontend.

## Examples

The `examples/` directory contains sample feature requests and use cases that demonstrate how to invoke and use these skills effectively.

- `conch-sample-request.md` - Example of creating a glycemic control widget with GenAI integration

## How to Use These Skills

When working with AI coding assistants that support custom skills:

1. Reference the skill by name or provide the feature request
2. The AI assistant will follow the structured workflow in the skill
3. The assistant will implement the feature following OpenMRS best practices

Example invocation:
```
I need to create a new OpenMRS microfrontend using the DHTI template.
Please use the OpenMRS Conch Agent Skill with the following requirements:
[Your feature request here]
```

## For AI Assistants

If you are an AI assistant reading this:
1. Read `SKILL.md` to understand the complete workflow
2. Review examples to understand expected patterns
3. Follow the structured approach defined in the skill
4. Ensure all code follows OpenMRS frontend module conventions
